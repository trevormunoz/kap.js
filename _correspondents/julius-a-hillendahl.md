Jules Hillendahl, also known as Kuno, married Katherine Anne’s younger sister, Mary Alice “Baby” Porter Hillendahl, in 1916.  Apparently members of the Hillendahl family were friends of the Porter family, as  Katherine Anne’s sisters arranged for her to  stay at a Hillendahl family farm in Spring Branch outside Houston  in 1913, details from which surfaced in her short story, “Holiday.”  Jules/Kuno was not a frequent correspondent of Katherine Anne’s, but she sometimes included well wishes for him in her letters to Baby.
