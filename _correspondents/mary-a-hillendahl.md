Mary Alice, most frequently called “Baby” by her family members, was Katherine Anne’s younger sister.  She married Herbert Lee Townsend in 1913, but he died a year later, prior to the birth of their son, Breckenridge.  She married Julius Arnold “Jules” Hillendahl in 1916.  	In her letters to Baby, Katherine Anne often describes the details of her own life and discusses their immediate family members.  The tone of the archived letters is generally friendly and affectionate, but Katherine Anne’s criticisms of Baby are well documented in her other family letters, especially those written to their sister Gay Porter Hollaway.  The complaints Katherine Anne had long made against Baby are documented in the last remaining letter she wrote to her younger sister in 1969.
