Katherine Anne was very attached to her first niece, Mary Alice Hollaway, born to Gay and Thomas Hollaway in 1912.  Katherine Anne lived with Gay and helped to care for Mary Alice following her birth and again after the birth of Gay’s second child, Thomas.  When Mary Alice died of spinal meningitis at age 6, Katherine Anne was devastated. Katherine Anne later wrote “A Christmas Story” (1946) about Mary Alice.
