Breckenridge Porter, Sr., was the only child born to Katherine Anne’s younger sister, Mary Alice “Baby” Porter Hillendahl.  Breckenridge’s father, Herbert Lee Townsend, died before he was born.  Katherine Anne visited Baby to help care for her and her son after his birth.  Breckenridge was later adopted by Katherine Anne’s brother, Paul Porter, Sr.   Katherine Anne’s 15 April 1930 letter mentions her sisters and asks sixteen-year-old Breckenridge to write to her.
